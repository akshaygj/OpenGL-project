# Campus Traverse
A project using OpenGL to show a walk-in simulation through the campus of my college

A project implemented using c++ and OpenGL in VisualStudio, aims at simulating the campus of my college. 
The campus is visualized in a 3D perspective view with keyboard and mouse inputs for navigating through the campus. The campus portrayed is a sample of how the real campus looks however details such as paint color and building dimensions couldn't be accounted for.
With help of textures I have shown the football field and also the idol in the temple. The interiors of the Mechanical block is also done with an indoor badminton court.

Input keys for the application:
  - w -Move forward
  - s -Move Backward
  - u -Move vertically up
  - j -Move vertically down
  - Mouse left click and drag right -Rotate view towards right
  - Mouse left click and drag left  -Rotate view towards left
